      <p>This would be an excellent place to describe what this page is for, what to find in different sections, describe any motivation or theme behind your visualizations, and so on.</p>

      <p>You should not use this template unless you intend to customize it. Make it your own. Keep in mind this simple template is over 300 lines! You can see other examples of websites using Bulma at their showcase: <a
