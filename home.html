        Visualization of San Francisco Crime Dataset
      </h1>

      <p>The main motive behind visualizing this dataset is to help the San Francisco Police department make the City of San Francisco, a safer place to live in for
        its public. San Francisco Police department authorities would find this visualization project useful to analyze data and plan for faster responses to incidents and hence reduce the crime-rate.
        This analysis hence provides better insight into the data. Effective visualization hence catches attention. I have talked about other primary goals in the different sections of this website.</p>

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>My goal behind visualizing this dataset is to determine:
        <ul>
          <li>Which neighborhood/district has the maximum number of missing person incidents?</li>
          <li>Is there a visible pattern between incidents accross neighborhood/districts?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
