     <h2 id="data">Data</h2>

        <p>Include some detailed information about the dataset here. You should <a href="#">add a link</a> to the original dataset. You might also want to quote the license:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "This data is made available under the Public Domain Dedication and License v1.0 whose full text can be found at: <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/">www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/</a>"
          </p>
          <cite>Put a citation here, possibly link to the dataset license information directly.</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>In addition to including a link to the source and license, you should describe the data. You might want a list of some sort to enumerate the different types of columns:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>

          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>

          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>

          <li><strong>Column Name:</strong> Give a description of the column, including its type and possible range of values.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This will of course differ depending on the assignment and data.</p>

        <h3 id="wrangling">Wrangling</h3>

        <p>Perhaps you had to do some data wrangling to the original dataset to prepare it for visualization. This would be a great place to discuss some of that wrangling.

        <pre>
You can even put code into these pre blocks.
  It will preserve whitespace.
    That is helpful for formatted code.
        </pre>

        <p>You can alternatively embed a Gist if you want. There is an "embed" button on <a href="https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae">the Gist page</a> and results in something like this:</p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/octocat/6cad326836d38bd3a7ae.js"></script>
